History of significant changes for PloneHelpCenter:

   (name of developer listed in brackets)

PloneHelpCenter 0.9

    - Another template / i18n update.
      [hannosch]

    - Made it possible to have standalone objects outside the Help Center
      (very useful for reference manuals, for example)
      [limi]
    
    - Major overhaul of all i18n files.
      [hannosch]

    - actually start using the ADD_HELP_AREA_PERMISSION as the
      add permission for HelpCenter, instead of the generic
      'Add Portal Content' permission
      [rafrombrc]

    - fixed lots of failing and erroring unit tests.  got all
      tests to pass w/ plones 2.0 and 2.1
      [rafrombrc]

    - Made Glossary's getItemsBySection() return sorted list.
      [optilude]

    - Made reference manual and todo navigation drop-downs select current page
      [optilude]

    - Removed Help Center workflow from TutorialPages for now. They should
      probably just have a simple in-progress/finished marker workflow that
      doesn't really affect permissions, but just whether they are listed
      or not in the index/page navigation. Had to remove it because of permission
      problems right now (if any pages are not published in a Tutorial, you get
      permission denied on the entire Tutorial).
      [limi]

PloneHelpCenter 0.2

    - Added Help Center portlet, this will aggregate published entries
      from all the available Help Centers, and display links to the published 
      help centers.
      [limi]

    - Added Glossary types, updated Help Center view
      [limi]

    - Added Link types
      [Joel]

    - Added ErrorReference types
      [Joel]

    - Added helpcenter_workflow & associate installation stuff.
      [Joel]

    - Cleaned up FAQFolder, HowtoFolder, TutorialFolder displays
      [Joel]

    - Folders now only list visible-to-users content
      [Joel]

    - Changed how versions are printed on pages: uses getVersions method
      rather than macro. Also, only prints a versions: line if there is
      anything in versions vocabulary--so, to create a help center that
      doesn't really use versions, just leave the vocab for this blank.
      It will still appear on Archetypes' forms, but won't show up
      one view modes
      [Joel]

    - Cleaned up and refactored text/doc files.
      [Joel]

    - Made many small API changes throughout. Sorry, but now this
      means that any existing Plone Help Centers will have to be migrated.
      I doubt if there are enough out there to justify making a 
      migration script. The API should be fairly stable from now on,
      but keep in mind this is still only a 0.2 release ;)
      [Joel]

    - added an optional ReferenceField (controlled in config.py) to cross-
      reference from a PHC-type to another Archetype in the portal. This 
      shouldnt affect existing code. If you have ATReferenceBrowserWidget
      installed its used instead of the dumb default ReferenceWidget.
      [Jensens]
